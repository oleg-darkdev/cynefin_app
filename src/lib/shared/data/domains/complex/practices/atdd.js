  shortDesc: `Acceptance test–driven development (ATDD) is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers.[54] ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by example (SBE),[55][56] behavior-driven development (BDD),[57] example-driven development (EDD),[58] and support-driven development also called story test–driven development (SDD).[59] All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer's needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language.`,
